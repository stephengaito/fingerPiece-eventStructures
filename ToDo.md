# Things To Do

- grounded event structures

- pomsets

- massive event structures

- look at Winskel's analysis of the necessary and sufficient conditions
  for grounded event structures in presheaves

- look at finite cylinders

- look at conditions to extend finite cylinders in both past and future
  (and space?)
  - may need reversibility of physics for this
  - big-bang is cosmological *not* physical

- provide annotated bibliography of Winskel's work on event structures
